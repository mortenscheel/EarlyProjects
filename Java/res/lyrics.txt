let's go hang out in a mall, or a morgue, 
a smorgasbord 
let's go hang out in a church 
we'll go find lurch 
then we'll haul ass down through the abbey 
is it money, is it fame
what's in a name, shame? 
is it money, is it fame
or were they always this lame?
it's a crazy, crazy mixed up town
it's the rattlesnake i fear
in another place, in another time
i'd be drivin' trucks my dear 
dear dear
let's go hang out in a bar
it's not too far 
we'll take my car
we'll lay flowers at the grave of jesco white 
the sinner's saint 
the rack is full and so are we
of laughing gas and ennui
it's a crazy, crazy mixed up town
it's the rattlesnake i fear
in another place, in another time
i'd be drivin' trucks my dear 
i'd be skinnin' hunted deer
deer deer 
it's a crazy, crazy mixed up town
but it's the rattlesnake i fear
in another place, in another time
i'd be drivin' trucks my dear 
i'd be skinnin' hunted deer
deer deer deer
